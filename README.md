# nature-of-code
Problem sets from The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman implemented in pure javascript.

## Goals
  - Work through most of the problem sets and examples in the Nature of Code book
  - Digest and internalize the concepts and algorithms presented there
  - Do so in pure javascript
  - Practice writing library style js code
  - No external dependencies - familiarize with the low-level 2d and 3d js rendering canvas
  - Do this in emacs using skewer and tern for a nice js dev environment
