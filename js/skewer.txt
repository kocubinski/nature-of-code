In case you forget...

skewer runs on top of simple-httpd
(require 'skewer) embeds skewer.js in any running httpd at /skewer
from any .html page -- include "http://localhost:8080/skewer" to connect back to emacs
skewer-mode and skewer-repl push updates to a connected browser
`httpd-serve-directory' is the command you want to use to server a given dir
